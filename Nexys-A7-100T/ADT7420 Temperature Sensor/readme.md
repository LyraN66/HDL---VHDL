# Reading Temperature Data and Displaying on the 7 Segment

  In this project I read the 13 bit (1 sign bit 12 data bit) temperature data from ADT7420 which is embedded on Nexys 4 DDR (Nexys A7 100T ) board and displayed on the
seven segment display.

## 7 Segment Display Section
![7 Segment CX](https://github.com/LyraN66/HDL---VHDL/assets/101515029/756ed35b-b12f-4dc6-b6a1-5927fb9402bc)
  
  As seen in the image above there are 8 different leds to display any data on the segment but notice that to give a light to segment '0' need to be send.
  
  Some of the numbers/letters shown down here

    reg [7:0] zero  = 8'b00000011;
    reg [7:0] one   = 8'b10011111;
    reg [7:0] two   = 8'b00100101; 
    reg [7:0] three = 8'b00001101;
    .
    .
    .
    reg [7:0] Aletter = 8'b00010001;    
    reg [7:0] bletter = 8'b11000001;    
    reg [7:0] Cletter = 8'b01100011;

  As seen in the image above, more than one data can't be send on the same time therefore I created a FSM to sent data.

    case (state)
            AN_0: begin
                digit <= 8'b11111110; 
                value <= Cletter;
                state <= AN_1;
            end
            AN_1: begin
                digit <= 8'b11111101;
                value <= degree;
                state <= AN_2;
                .
                .
                .
    endcase

  In the FSM for 7 Segment Display "digit" parameter defines which segment will display the "value" parameter 
which is depended on the data which comes from sensor.

## ADT7420 Temperature Sensor Section

  ADT7420 use I2C for communication as specified in the datasheet master should pull down sda while scl is high 
which gives a start bit for communication. Then I send the slave address (0x4B) + R/W bit , then master waits an 
ack from slave. After receiving ack I send the internal register address which I want to read data from there then
again waits an ack from slave after this we are reading the data while SCL is high.

  In the datasheet of ADT7420 SCL timing is showed clearly. According to these values I created parameter which are used in FSM of sensor.

    localparam TIME_1SEC   =50000000; //(INTERVAL/CLK_PER);// Clock ticks in 1 sec
    localparam TIME_THDSTA =60; //(600/CLK_PER);     // 0.6 us
    localparam TIME_TSUSTA =60; //(600/CLK_PER);     // 0.6 us
    .

  In the image below resolution of the sensor is stated. In 16 bit of data first 3 bit (0.,1. and 2.) are reserved 
for flags and last bit (15.) is reserved for sign bit. Therefore [15:3] bits are data bits. Multipliying with 0.0625
per bit means also shifting right by 4 bit. Therefore last 4 bit of data portion represents the fraction part of the data.

                integer_digit_2 <= conversion_integer_data / 10;
                integer_digit_1 <= conversion_integer_data % 10;
                fraction_digit_2 <= conversion_fraction_data / 1000;
                fraction_digit_1_temp <= conversion_fraction_data % 1000;
                fraction_digit_1 <= fraction_digit_1_temp / 100;

  In 13 bit reading mode ADT7420 gives a 0.0625 Â°C per bit which requires a conversion part.

  As a last thing FSM for sensor is showed in the above image. It checks the number of data bit to decide to finish or continue.
